## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive typography (rem units)

### What I learned

Key takeaways from this project:

- **CSS Variable Organization**:
Structured color and font variables in `:root` for easy theme management and consistency across components.

- **Responsive Image Handling**:
Combined relative units `vw` and `rem` for minimum height to ensure the image adapts beautifully across devices.

- **Accessibility Focus**:
Prioritized semantic HTML and appropriate heading hierarchy to ensure the recipe is usable for all audiences, including screen reader users.

- **Problem Solving**: Created own mockup using Figma since I only had access to the screenshot of the design and got better at using browser tools to test my design

### Continued development
- I faced challenges in accurately measuring elements and spacing since I only had a screenshot of the design to work with. Without access to the original Figma file, I had to recreate the entire layout manually in Figma.
- Fortunately, all those Figma tutorials and practice projects I did on my own really paid off. I was able to figure it out and finish my mockup on Figma.
